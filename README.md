### Overview

We will present a physical interactive model of the famous LEM Lander game, where the user attempts to land a Rocket model (suspended from a four tower cable system) that has limited fuel onto a crater-filled lunar surface.  The game has outputs to indicate the speed, altitude, and fuel level remaining, together with light and sound effects. There will be physical controller inputs for the thrust and direction, plus controls for the game play.
