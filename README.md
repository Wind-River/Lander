# Lander
We will present a physical interactive model of the famous LEM Lander game, where the user attempts to land a Lunar Excursion Module (suspended from a X-Y-Z table) that has limited fuel onto a crater-filled lunar surface.  The lander model will have LED's to indicate the thrusters plus an RGB LED to indicate the speed and fuel level remaining so that onlookers can participate. There will be a physical controller, with a smart phone controller also planned (via XDK).  We will base this on Pulsar so that we can also demonstrate the resilience of the container design for this critical operation, with a button that onlookers can press to interactively 'fail' one of the containers and observe the recovery.
