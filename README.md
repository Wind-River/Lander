### Overview

We will present a physical interactive model of the famous LEM Lander game, where the user attempts to land a Rocket model (suspended from a four tower cable system) that has limited fuel onto a crater-filled lunar surface.  The game has outputs to indicate the speed, altitude, and fuel level remaining, together with light and sound effects. There will be a physical controller, with a smart phone controller also planned (via XDK).
